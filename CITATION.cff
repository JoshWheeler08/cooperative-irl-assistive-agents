  abstract: "This dissertation investigates whether Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) based intention recognition algorithms can improve human-robot cooperation in assistive systems. Inspired by the altruistic behavior observed in 18-month-old children who can infer and assist with human intentions, this work explores embedding similar capabilities into AI assistants. Using the Knights, Archers, Zombies (KAZ) cooperative game environment as a testbed, the research evaluates multiple IRL algorithms (AIRL, GAIL, Behavioral Cloning, DAgger, etc.) in their ability to enable an assistant agent to anticipate and support a human agent's actions. The work contributes a flexible, plug-and-play testing framework for cooperative IRL research and provides evidence regarding the effectiveness of IRL-based intention recognition for anticipatory assistance."
